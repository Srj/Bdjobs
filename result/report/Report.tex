\section{Software Engineer}
True in table \ref{tab:Software Engineer_number_applicants_ttest} means that there was significant difference in the job post during that time period.

In \textbf{Electronics / Consumers Durables} field there was a significant change in vacancy for software Engineer from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018. But Surprisingly there was no change from 2016 to 2018 i.e. in a two yr period. The explanation for this is the graph. From 16 to 17 in dropped abruptly and again from 17 to 18 it raised. So, on a two year run there was no significant difference but on one year run there was. Same pattern follows for Manufacturing Industries. See figure \ref{fig:Software Engineer_number_applicants_ttest} for details.
